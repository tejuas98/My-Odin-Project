<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Base:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Combine milk, cream, sugar, and cocoa powder in a saucepan.</li>
      <li>Heat the mixture until it simmers and thickens, making sure the sugar and cocoa are fully dissolved.</li>
      <li>Optional: For a custard base, whisk egg yolks with a portion of the hot mixture, then return it to the pan and cook gently until thickened.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Incorporate Chocolate:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the base from heat and stir in chopped chocolate until fully melted and smooth.</li>
      <li>Optional no-cook method: Whisk cocoa powder, sugar, and milk until dissolved, then fold into whipped cream.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Chill the Base:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Cool the mixture completely using an ice bath or by refrigerating for several hours.</li>
      <li>This step is crucial for achieving the best texture in the final ice cream.</li>
    </ul>
